**getCountryData.R** is the script used to analyze global SARS-CoV-2 sequence metadata.

**singleCountrySimulations.R** is used to generate the single-country simulations.

**simulateGlobalEpidemics.R** is used to generate the global metapopulation epidemic simulations.

**surveillanceSimulations_detection.R** is used to simulate the global genomic surveillance process, given the global epidemic simulations, for detection.

**surveillanceSimulations_threshold.R** is used to simulate the global genomic surveillance process, given the global epidemic simulations, for the time until the variant is found to exceed a threshold proportion.

**GLEAMvalidate.R** is used to validate the metapopulation model against simulation output from GLEAM.

**getLeadTimes.R** is used to compute the time between first global detection and first local case in each country.
